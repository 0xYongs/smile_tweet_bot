JOYBOT by yongs

JOYBOT is a Python-based bot that promotes your Twitter account by automatically tweeting content on your behalf. The bot is built using the Tweepy library, which provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the Twitter API.

Features
Automatic tweeting: Once the bot is set up, it will automatically tweet content on your behalf at regular intervals.
Customizable content: You can easily customize the content that the bot tweets by modifying the tweets list in the main.py file.
Easy to configure: All you need to get started with the bot is a set of Twitter API credentials, which you can obtain by creating a new Twitter app in the Twitter Developer Dashboard.
Continuous development: The bot is open-source and actively maintained, with new features and improvements being added regularly.

Getting started
To get started with the bot, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Create a new Twitter app in the Twitter Developer Dashboard.
Copy your API keys and access tokens into the config.py file.
Modify the tweets list in the main.py file to customize the content that the bot will tweet.
Run the main.py script to start the bot.
